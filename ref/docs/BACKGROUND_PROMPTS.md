# CryptoCore — Website Background Prompts

These prompts are designed for **full-page website backgrounds** displayed beneath a dark overlay (`bg-black/60` to `bg-black/80`).
The goal is atmosphere — not detail. Images should be **dark, moody, and low-contrast** so UI elements remain readable on top.
